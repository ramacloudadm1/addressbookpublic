== Introduction

JitHub is for students who prefer to use a desktop app for managing student contacts, emails and calendar.
More importantly, JitHub is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, JitHub can get
your daily tasks such as checking schedule done faster than traditional GUI apps.
